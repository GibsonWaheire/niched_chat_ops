                  Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device when you visit our website or use our Service. These files contain information about your browsing activity and preferences, allowing us to remember your settings and provide a personalized experience. Cookies are stored in your web browser and can be either temporary (session cookies) that are deleted when you close your browser, or persistent (stored cookies) that remain on your device for a specified period. They are generally safe and cannot access your personal files or execute code on your device.

                <p className="text-base">
                  Essential cookies are necessary for the Service to function properly and cannot be disabled. These cookies enable core functionality such as user authentication, session management, security features, and load balancing. Without these cookies, you would not be able to log into your account, maintain your session, or access secure areas of the Service. Essential cookies include authentication tokens that verify your identity, session identifiers that maintain your login state, and security cookies that protect against unauthorized access and cross-site request forgery attacks.

                  Performance cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our Service by collecting information about page views, navigation patterns, and user behavior. We use these cookies to analyze website traffic, identify popular features, detect and resolve performance issues, and improve the overall user experience. These cookies may include Google Analytics cookies that provide insights into user demographics, page load times, and conversion rates. The information collected is aggregated and anonymized to protect your privacy while helping us optimize our Service for better performance and usability.

                  Functional cookies remember your preferences and settings to provide a customized experience. These cookies store information such as your language preference, theme selection, dashboard layout, and form auto-fill data. They enable features like remembering your last search queries, maintaining your workspace configuration, and preserving your notification preferences. While these cookies are not essential for basic Service functionality, they significantly enhance your user experience by eliminating the need to reconfigure settings each time you visit. You can choose to disable these cookies, but doing so may result in a less personalized experience.

                  Marketing cookies are used to deliver relevant advertisements and track the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. These cookies may be placed by our advertising partners and help us understand which marketing channels are most effective, measure campaign performance, and deliver targeted content based on your interests. They may also enable social media integration features, allowing you to share content or connect your social media accounts. Marketing cookies are not essential for Service functionality and can be disabled through your browser settings or our cookie consent management system.

                <p className="text-base">
                  Our Service integrates with various third-party services that may place their own cookies on your device. These services include payment processors like Stripe for secure transactions, communication platforms like Twilio for SMS and voice services, analytics providers like Google Analytics for website insights, and social media platforms for integration features. Each third-party service has its own privacy policy and cookie practices, which we recommend reviewing to understand how they collect and use your information. We carefully select our third-party partners and require them to maintain appropriate data protection standards.

                <p className="text-base">
                  The lifespan of cookies varies depending on their purpose and type. Session cookies are temporary and are automatically deleted when you close your browser or end your session. Persistent cookies remain on your device for a specified period, which may range from a few days to several years, depending on the cookie's purpose and your browser settings. We regularly review and update our cookie expiration policies to ensure they align with our data retention practices and legal obligations. You can manually delete cookies at any time through your browser settings, though this may affect your Service experience.

                <p className="text-base">
                  You have several options for managing cookies and controlling how they are used. Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings, including blocking all cookies, blocking specific types of cookies, or deleting existing cookies. You can also configure your browser to notify you when cookies are being set, giving you the choice to accept or decline them. Additionally, we provide a cookie consent banner that allows you to customize your preferences for non-essential cookies. You can access and modify your cookie preferences at any time through our Service settings or by contacting our support team.

                <p className="text-base">
                  While you have the right to disable cookies, doing so may impact your Service experience and functionality. Disabling essential cookies will prevent you from accessing the Service, as these cookies are required for basic operations like authentication and security. Disabling performance cookies may limit our ability to identify and resolve technical issues, while disabling functional cookies may result in a less personalized experience and the need to reconfigure settings each time you visit. Marketing cookies can be safely disabled without affecting core Service functionality, though you may see less relevant advertisements and content.

                  Our mobile applications and mobile-optimized websites also use cookies and similar tracking technologies. Mobile cookies serve similar purposes to web cookies, including authentication, session management, and user experience optimization. However, mobile cookie management may differ from desktop browsers, and you may need to adjust settings within your mobile device's operating system or individual app permissions. Some mobile platforms provide additional privacy controls that allow you to limit tracking across apps and websites, which may affect how cookies function in our mobile applications.
